TODO


.B .W .L -- add a modifier field.  * uses it for the read size.  all others use it when token converted to integer.

debugger improvements:

completion context:

when in tbrk, lookup based on the toolbox map ninstead of general symbol table?


symbol table should be a range.  Debug names are loaded as start:end.  
In scalar context, just use the start value.  
In range context, use as a range unless specific range or count provided.

eg:

main;l <- list all of main

new command: protect
usage: protect range 
(where range can be explicit or a debug name)
prevents tracing within the defined code.


last address
expression evaluation updates the last address.  ;command is equivalent to lastaddress;command.


- tool to list iigs/mac resource fork (rlist)


1. scan file for debug names (starting at 4e56 - link a6), load into environment table (with tools)
2. address break, ^C break, etc - list reason *before* disasm line
4. ; commands - keep track of last address (;l to repeat...)

5. run until return? (t bits in csr?)

6. local variables (set/clear)
set identifier '=' expression
unset identifier

expression '(' expression ')' -> 16-bit offset.


stack dump?  any safe way to get the previous address (how many bytes for jsr?)

option for MPW 3.2 vs 3.5?
store as MPWVersion (standard shell variable)
CLibraries=$MPW:Libraries:CLibraries-$MPWVersion:




--trace-cpu:
- add support for global vars [?]
- improve MOVEM disassembly [?]

---

- --24 flag for non-32-bit clean code

- since code segments are loaded from a resource and the code may try to reload itself (ResourceByName), it really needs to be done via the emulated ResourceMgr/Memory Manager.

- ftrap_editor_tabs


- move time to OS::, add OS::Init to set start time global / ticks
- use alarm / ualarm to update ticks/ time global?

- duplicate / duplicate iigs replacement

- stdout -- convert macroman to utf8 on output?



Done
----
- set the time global @ start up (Pascal res files)

- rbreak/wbreak/rwbreak - break on memory access
- orca/c : symfile support.

- Use MM code for all memory allocs
- GetFileInfo -- create fake finderinfo record from extension. 
- check for stack range errors
- add memory manager code
- add stand-alone disasm utility
- log memory access to global vars
- --trace-cpu: add support for tool traps
- --trace-cpu: move trace-cpu code into a logger callback

- ftrap_delete
- if file doesn't exist, check in $MPW/Tools/

- include file w/ all global names
- include file w/ all os errors
